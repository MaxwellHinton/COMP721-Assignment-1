                <h3 class="questions">Q1: What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</h3>
                
                I didn't attempt any big changes. I did add some small additions such as: <br>

                1. Added the underline on hover feature to my main links.
            
            
            </p>

                <h3 class="questions">Q2: What part(s) did you have trouble with?</h3>

                Since I haven't had much experience with databases and MYSQL. Sending queries and opening connections
                was something I struggled with. <br>

                This was also my first time using CSS, so styling and more specifically spacing elements was challenging.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3 class="questions">Q3: What would you like to do better next time?</h3>

                Next time I'd like to spend more time styling and using images as links etc. <br>

                In the future I'd like to add user authentication and a home page where users can scroll through all of the status' uploaded
                within their circle. 

            </p>

            <p>
                <h3 class="questions">Q4: What have you learn along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project?</h3>

                I learnt alot about HTML+CSS, and SQL. Learning how to interact with databases using PHP, how to use CSS for basic
                styling, and how users and webpages interact with each other. <br><br>

                Notable References: <br>
                - StackOverflow. <br>
                - ChatGPT - For explanations on different styling options and implementations.<br>
                - GitHub - Ultimate coding resources.
